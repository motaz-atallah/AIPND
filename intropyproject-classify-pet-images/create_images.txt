Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: No,
        Here are the differences in the classifications:

            1- Alexnet:
                 - Classifier: english foxhound

            2- Resnet:
                 - Classifier: english foxhound

            3- Vgg:
                 - Classifier: walker hound, walker foxhound

        Both Alexnet and Resnet correctly classified the breed as "english foxhound," 
        while Vgg misclassified it as "walker hound, walker foxhound."

2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: No,
        Here are the differences in the classifications:
            1- Alexnet:
                - English_Foxhound_01.jpg: english foxhound
                - English_Foxhound_02.jpg: english foxhound

            2- Resnet:
                - English_Foxhound_01.jpg: english foxhound
                - English_Foxhound_02.jpg: english foxhound

            3- Vgg:
                - English_Foxhound_01.jpg: walker hound, walker foxhound
                - English_Foxhound_02.jpg: english foxhound

        Alexnet and Resnet consistently classified both English_Foxhound_01.jpg and English_Foxhound_02.jpg as 
        "english foxhound." However, Vgg classified English_Foxhound_01.jpg as "walker hound, walker foxhound" 
        and English_Foxhound_02.jpg as "english foxhound," indicating an inconsistency in the Vgg model's 
        classifications for the two images.

3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: Yes


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: Based on the provided data, both Alexnet and Resnet performed equally well in classifying the four uploaded images,
        so either could be chosen as the best model. 
        However, given Resnet's generally superior performance in a wider range of image classification tasks, 
        it is preferred. It's important to note that this judgment is based on a very small dataset, 
        and results might vary with a larger and more diverse set of images. 
        Therefore, Resnet is selected as the best model for this specific task.
